# ContactManagementSystem
Contact Management System in the C programming language is a software application that allows users to store, organize and manage large numbers of contact records efficiently. The system is designed to have functions such as adding, updating, editing, listing and deleting contacts.


## Functionality Highlights:
 
-  Add a New Contact: Users can input details such as first name, last name, phone number, address, and email to create a new contact entry. The system ensures that the phone number entered is valid and not more than 10 digits.
 
- List All Contacts: Users can view a list of all existing contacts stored in the system. Contacts are displayed with their respective details including name, phone number, address, and email.
 
- Search for Contact: Users can search for a specific contact by entering the phone number. If the contact exists, its details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating that no record was found is shown.
 
- Delete a Contact: Users can delete a contact by specifying the phone number associated with it. Upon deletion, the system removes the contact from the contact list.
 
- Edit a Contact: Users can edit an existing contact by entering its phone number. They can then update the contact's details including the first name, last name, phone number, address, and email.
- Exit: Users can exit the contact management system.
  

## Requirements for using it

- A software (IDE) for reviewing the code
- C/C++ compiler (Recommended: GCC Compiler)
